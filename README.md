ngStarter
============

Starter for Angular-1x projects using John Papa style guide.
Use node `>=6.3` and npm `>=3.10.3`

## Install dependencies


* `npm install`
* `bower install`


## Start development


* `npm start`
* Go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.


## Tests


`npm run test`


## Production ready build - a.k.a. dist


`npm run dist`

Now there's a `./dist` folder with all scripts and stylesheets concatenated and minified, also third party libraries installed with bower will be concatenated and minified into `vendors.min.js` and `vendors.min.css` respectively.
